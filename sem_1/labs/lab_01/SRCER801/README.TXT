Sourcer 8.01 Commenting Disassembler

The Sourcer package gives the power to look inside binary files
such as Windows EXEs, DLLs, VxDs, Device drivers, DOS programs, BIOS ROMs and more!
Sourcer and its tools create detailed commented assembly source code and listings.
The new Sourcer 8.0 package includes Sourcer, the BIOS Preprocessor and Windows Source,
which are described in more detail below.

Advanced Commenting Disassembler

Sourcer creates detailed commented source code and listing from memory and executable files.
A built in data analyzer and code simulator identifies segments and resolves data across multiple segments.
Sourcer provides detailed comments on interrupts, I/O ports, and much more.
Determines the necessary assembler directives for reassembly.
Includes a definition file facility to provide your own remarks and descriptive labels,
force data types provide additional controls.

New! Sourcer 8.0 (Nov 2000) includes both the BIOS Pre-processor and Windows Source and adds many improvements.
Also now includes Diff-It, to examine the differences between two text or binary files.

  Sourcer features:

? Most DOS files reassemble byte identical to original
? Automatic handling of indexed jumps and calls
? Identifies interrupt entry points in most TSRs
? Cross references appear where items are defined
? Automatic device driver and Windows VxD detection
? Correct mnemonic for multiple mnemonic instructions
? Supports Pentium III to 8088 and MMX instruction sets
? Ability to handle many compressed and encrypted files
? Supports math coprocessors and emulated math instructions

  Additional features:

? Automatic analysis to build a table of indexed calls or jumps
? Add your own comments and descriptive labels
? Output choice of ASM or listings
? Includes comments for all DOS & BIOS interrupt sub-functions and most other common interrupts, and many undocumented functions
? Includes comments for most I/O ports
? Many options to adjust the output style and suppress classes of comments
? Unravels many tricks used to obscure code
? Unique in-line cross-reference for all calls, jumps, and data items
? Allows virtualization of program at any 1MB address
? Identifies parameters and local variables in C and Pascal code

  Specification:

Instruction set support ?
8088, V20/V30, 80186, 80286, 80287, 80386, 80387, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III (except SIMD).
Also supports both 16 bit and 32 bit instruction set modes, floating point, and MMX. AMD's compatible x86 instructions.
AMD non-x86 compatible instructions are not included, but can be manually added using Sourcer's macro capabilities.

Input file types ?
Binary files, COM and BIN type files, multi-segment files, non-Windows EXE type files (up to 250 segments, unpacked),
device drivers, program overlays, system files (.SYS), Windows VxDs, many compressed and encrypted type files,
and any RAM or ROM address in the first 1 MB of address space.
Windows Source (included) handles Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP type EXEs, DLLs, VxDs and more.
Sourcer also includes our Unpacker utility to convert packed EXE files back to the original unpacked form for disassembly.

Input file size limit ?
450 KB typical on most Windows environments and clean DOS environments.
For Windows PE type files, an additional disassembler is included for huge files (beyond 450 KB in size).

Output ?
User¡¯s choice of assembly listing or assembly source code output styles.

OS Requirements ?
Windows 95/98/Me or DOS to run (Windows NT, 2000 and OS/2 are not recommended)
